## Problem:

### Task and project tracking management

Task and project tracking management software is a tool designed to help teams organize and manage their tasks and projects effectively. The software allows users to create task lists and assign tasks to team members, set due dates and priorities, and track task progress. In addition, the software can include collaboration features, such as comments and notifications, to keep team members informed about project progress and updates. It can also generate reports and analytics on team performance and project progress, which helps managers and team leaders make informed decisions about future work and workflow.

## Solution:

This solution is built for the purpose of managing projects and project tasks. You can create, update, list, and delete, open and complete projects, within which there are tasks, with the same functionalities but these will be assigned and completed. For the theme of the users, there will be Admin/Leader roles and collaborators who will sign up to the projects.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.5.
